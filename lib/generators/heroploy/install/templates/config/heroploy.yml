# This file shows you how to configure your Heroploy environments.  For more

load_configs:
  
# If you wish to define parts of your config file (e.g. secret keys) in a
# private repository, you can load these files here:
#
# my_private_config:
#   repo: git.example.com:my-private-repo
#   file: config/heroploy.yml

common:
  required:

# List any configuration variables which should be defined for each environment
# here.  For example, if you require each to have a facebook_app_key:
#
#   - facebook_app_key

  variables:

# If you wish to define any variables which should be common to all
# environments, add them here:
#
#   facebook_app_key: a1b2c3
  
environments:

# Add a development environment, to which you can deploy anything:
#
# development:
#   app: my-development-app

# You may also want a staging environment, to which you can only deploy pushed
# commits from master:
#
# staging:
#   app: my-staging-app
#   checks:
#     pushed: true
#     branch: master

# And here's a possible production app, which requires changes to have first
# been staged:
  
# production:
#   app: my-production-app
#   tag: 'RELEASE_%Y%m%dT%H%M%S%z'
#   checks:
#     pushed: true
#     branch: master
#     staged: true

# If you want to set any config vars on your Heroku apps, you can define them
# on a per-environment basis:

# development:
#   app: my-development-app
#   variables:
#     facebook_app_key: a1b2c3


# Finally, if you have a single Heroku app, this should work for now:

  heroku:
    app: my-heroku-app-name
    tag: 'RELEASE_%Y%m%dT%H%M%S%z'
    checks:
      pushed: true
      branch: master
