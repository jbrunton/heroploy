environments:

# Add a development environment, to which you can deploy anything:
#
# development:
#   app: my-development-app

# You may also want a staging environment, to which you can only deploy pushed
# commits from master:
#
# staging:
#   app: my-staging-app
#   checks:
#     pushed: true
#     branch: master

# And here's a possible production app, which requires changes to have first
# been staged:
  
# production:
#   app: my-production-app
#   tag: 'RELEASE_%Y%m%dT%H%M%S%z'
#   checks:
#     pushed: true
#     branch: master
#     staged: true

# Finally, if you have a single Heroku app, this should work for now:

  heroku:
    app: my-heroku-app-name
    tag: 'RELEASE_%Y%m%dT%H%M%S%z'
    checks:
      pushed: true
      branch: master
